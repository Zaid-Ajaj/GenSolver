## Background



## Setup



## Building
The build can be started by running:

* `build.sh` on unix systems (tested on max os x)
* `build.cmd` on windows systems

Running `build.cmd` or `./build.sh` is the same as running the command with the `ALL` argument. To list all build targets use the `--listTargets` or `-lt` argument.
